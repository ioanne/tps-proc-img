Conversion between bytes and images in memory.

`ImageCodec` is used by the service to:
  - inspect an uploaded file (is it an image? which format and size?),
  - open a stored file as an image ready to be processed,
  - encode the result of an operation back to bytes, in memory, before the
    storage writes it to disk.
